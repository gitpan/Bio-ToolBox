=head1 NAME

Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::bigbed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module supports the use of bigBed file in the biotoolbox scripts.
It is used to collect the dataset scores from a binary 
bigBed file (.bb). The file may be local or remote.

Scores may be restricted to strand by specifying the desired strandedness. 
For example, to collect transcription data over a gene, pass the strandedness 
value 'sense'. If the strand of the region database object (representing the 
gene) matches the strand of the bed feature, then the data for that bed 
feature is collected.  

For loading bigbed files into a Bio::DB database, see the biotoolbox perl 
script 'big_filegff3.pl'.

=head1 USAGE

The module requires Lincoln Stein's Bio::DB::BigBed to be installed. 

Load the module at the beginning of your program.

	use Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::bigbed;

It will automatically export the name of the subroutines. 

=over

=item collect_bigbed_scores

This subroutine will collect only the data values from a binary bigbed file 
for the specified database region. The positional information of the 
scores is not retained, and the values are best further processed through 
some statistical method (mean, median, etc.).

The subroutine is passed seven or more arguments in the following order:
    
    1) The chromosome or seq_id
    2) The start position of the segment to collect 
    3) The stop or end position of the segment to collect 
    4) The strand of the original feature (or region), -1, 0, or 1.
    5) A scalar value representing the desired strandedness of the data 
       to be collected. Acceptable values include "sense", "antisense", 
       or "all". Only those scores which match the indicated 
       strandedness are collected.
    6) The method or type of data collected. 
       Acceptable values include 'score' (returns the bed feature 
       score), 'count' (returns the number of bed features found), or 
       'length' (returns the length of the bed features found).  
    7) The paths, either local or remote, to one or more BigBed files.

The subroutine returns an array of the defined dataset values found within 
the region of interest. 

=item collect_bigbed_position_scores

This subroutine will collect the score values from a binary bigBed file 
for the specified database region keyed by position. 

The subroutine is passed the same arguments as collect_bigbed_scores().

The subroutine returns a hash of the defined dataset values found within 
the region of interest keyed by position. The feature midpoint is used 
as the key position. When multiple features are found at the same 
position, a simple mean (for score or length data methods) or sum 
(for count methods) is returned.

=item open_bigbed_db()

This subroutine will open a BigBed database connection. Pass either the 
local path to a bigBed file (.bb extension) or the URL of a remote bigBed 
file. It will return the opened database object.

The opened BigBed object is cached for later use. If you do not want this 
(for example, when forking), pass a second true argument.

=item sum_total_bigbed_features()

This subroutine will sum the total number of bed features present in a 
BigBed file. This may be useful, for example, in calculating fragments 
(reads) per million mapped values when the bigbed file represents 
sequence alignments.

Pass either the name of a bigBed file (.bb), either local or remote, or an 
opened BigBed database object. A scalar value of the total number of features 
is returned.
