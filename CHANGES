######## Bio::ToolBox revision history #############

v.1.18 (svn 826)
	- Fixed critical bug when calculating RPM and RPKM values in 
	data collection scripts. This is a long-standing bug that 
	produced erroneous values. The bug does not affect bam2wig.pl 
	rpm reporting.
	- Improved methods for collecting from subfeatures such as 
	exons of genes or transcripts in script get_datasets.pl.
	- Added option to specify which UCSC table(s) to use when 
	setting up a new database in script db_setup.pl.
	- Added new options to extend and concatenate sequences in 
	script data2fasta.pl.
	- Added ability to use the samtools fasta index when available 
	in scripts data2fasta.pl and CpG_calculator.pl. This index is 
	about 10-20% faster than the BioPerl fasta index.
	- Fixed bug to avoid illegal characters in filenames when 
	splitting data files, and added an option to use a custom 
	file prefix in script split_data_file.pl.
	- Fixed bug where ensembl gene names may not be properly 
	recorded in the output GFF3 file in script ucsc_table2gff3.pl. 

v.1.17 (svn 808)
	- Added six new method functions to Bio::ToolBox::Data for 
	working with columns and metadata.
	- Updated script correlate_position_data.pl with parallel 
	execution plus an ANOVA statistical analysis between data.
	- Fixed bug where the --bwapp option was not being used in 
	script bam2wig.pl. Thanks to Michael D. for reporting.
	- Removed extraneous BioPerl warnings when opening a fasta file 
	or directory fails, and replaced with some suggestions.
	- Fixed bug with RPM option that lead to warnings in db_helper.
	- Simplified warning for duplicate lookup values in script 
	merge_datasets.pl.
	- Reorganized the POD summary and provided examples of usage 
	for main data collection scripts, plus provide default values 
	in POD summaries for a number of scripts. Thanks to Christian 
	for the recommendation.

v.1.16 (svn 794)
	- Fixed critical bug that prevented the forward strand from 
	being written when generating stranded coverage in script 
	bam2wig.pl. Thanks to Michael D. for reporting.
	- Fixed critical bug that prevented the script get_bam_seq_stats.pl 
	from compiling properly.
	- Fixed bug that prevented filtering more than one length at 
	a time in script filter_bam.pl. Thanks to Yixuan for reporting.
	- Fixed again the bug where passing a negative or zero start 
	to data collection methods issues a warning and resets the value 
	to 1 in db_helper.

v.1.15 (svn 786)
	- Added Bio::ToolBox::Data method to delete column metadata
	and improved adding new metadata.
	- Added back cached database objects for data collection, 
	which brings back speed lost in the previous version. 
	- Original strand format is now maintained when rewriting data 
	files. For example, + and - from Bed and GFF files as opposed 
	to 1 and -1.
	- Passing a negative or zero start value to data collection 
	methods in db_helper now issues a friendly warning and resets 
	the value to 1.
	- Opening a BigWigSet directory of bigWig files can now infer 
	strand based on filename and set the metadata appropriately. 
	For example, files whose basename ends in f, forward, or plus 
	will be interpreted as strand 1. 
	- Script gff3_to_ucsc_table.pl was significantly updated to 
	address critical flaws and change the output format to refFlat.
	- Script manipulate_datasets.pl no longer writes metadata for 
	simple file formats when using certain functions that do not 
	change data content.
	- Script bam2wig.pl now includes a --flip strand option.
	- Scripts graph_data.pl and graph_profile.pl have fixed errors 
	and made improvements regarding fonts and sizes. 
	- Various other small bug fixes and checks for optional Perl 
	module installs.
	- Updated shebang lines to use universal /usr/bin/perl
	- Updated script POD documentation to make common options more 
	uniform.
	

v.1.14.1 (svn 763)
	- Changed the method of caching database objects introduced 
	in version 1.14, which wreaked havoc with forked child 
	processes. All database connections are cached by default 
	and returned if subsequently re-opened, unless explicitly 
	told to not use the cached connection. Multiple scripts 
	were updated to reflect the new connection caching. 
	- Bio::ToolBox::Data now automatically re-clones existing 
	database connections if you splice the data table.
	- Bam file index files are now explicitly generated prior 
	to opening the bam file database connection. Additionally, 
	existing .bai files are copied as .bam.bai in preference 
	to creating a new .bam.bai file. Thanks to Yixuan for 
	reporting.
	- Fixed POD errors in script bar2wig.pl and updated method 
	for finding the java executable file. Thanks to Guillaume 
	for reporting.
	- Removed debugging warn statements in script 
	get_relative_data.pl.
	- Added POD documentation to Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::useq.

v.1.14 (svn 737)
	- Massive reorganization of the entire package into a proper 
	Perl module distribution that is installed using standard 
	Module::Build methods. This will install the libraries into 
	site-specific Perl library directories as Bio::ToolBox::*. 
	Scripts will install into a standard bin directory. All 
	scripts have been updated to reflect these changes.
	- Added new module Bio::ToolBox::Data, which provides an easy 
	object-oriented interface to working with data files and the 
	rest of the Bio::ToolBox functions. 
	- Added new script db_setup.pl to ease generating an annotation 
	database with UCSC data
	- Added Build tests for all major library functions, including 
	score collections from all binary database adaptors.
	- Added capability to properly collect value types, including 
	score, count, and length, from useq and wiggle database adaptors
	- Loosened restriction for counting Bam alignments where the 
	midpoint had to be within the query region; now any overlapping 
	alignment that intersects the region will be counted.
	- Reworked the interpolation algorithm to interpolate as many 
	datapoints as possible in script get_relative_data.pl.
	- Removed cryptic error messages when opening databases, and 
	added database handle caching to avoid repeated openings
	- Newly generated feature lists no longer append all aliases to 
	the feature name
	- Added additional attributes to the list of available ones to 
	retrieve from the database in script get_feature_info.pl. Also 
	added a --type command line option to set a feature type to 
	named features.
	- Improved data table checking to include a count of columns 
	for every row.
	- Added max_count option to script bam2wig.pl to control for 
	high Bam coverage
	- Fixed bug where the summary file was not created for 
	script get_relative_data.pl

v.1.13 (svn 691)
	- Updated to include native support for USeq archive files 
	with data collection scripts. USeq files may be used in 
	the same manner as BigWig, BigBed, or Bam files for data 
	collection. USeq files may be generated using tools from 
	the USeq package (useq.sourceforge.net). The 
	Bio::DB::USeq adaptor is available via CPAN. 
	- Added new script filter_bam.pl, which can filter alignments 
	based on various criteria and write a new Bam file. Filters 
	are one or more boolean tests, including attributes, scores, 
	lengths, sequence, etc.
	- Added new script get_bam_seq_stats.pl, which collects 
	information about the read sequences themselves and summarizes 
	the sequence composition and nucleotide frequencies, suitable 
	for generating sequence logos.
	- Updated script manipulate_datasets.pl to allow any integer 
	to be used when formatting decimal values.
	- Restored ability to write a new data file without collecting 
	data from script get_datasets.pl.
	- Changed the log conversion step to avoid having to increase 
	read count by 1 to avoid log of 0 errors in script bam2wig.pl.
	- Use the command line --log argument in preference over 
	metadata in script manipulate_datasets.pl.
	- Method sum now writes 0 instead of null in script 
	bin_genomic_data.pl.
	- Fixed issue where joining data files may not maintain gzip 
	status. This had issues with combining forked children files.
	- Fixed bug where a provided, indexed data source file 
	(e.g. BigWig) could not be used as a database in script 
	get_datasets.pl

v.1.12.6 (svn 680)
	- Updated the script novo_wrapper.pl to use Parallel::ForkManager 
	instead of GNU Parallel. This should make it more stable, 
	particularly under nohup.
	- Consolidated the standard out results when functions were 
	applied to multiple columns in script manipulate_datasets.pl. 
	This will make the script much less chatty.
	- Fixed bug with naming temporary forked children file names.
	- Fixed bugs with the generation of summary files.
	- Fixed bug with the automatic identification of the X axis in 
	script graph_profile.pl.
	- Fixed bug where features not found in a database could crash 
	the script get_feature_info.pl.
v.1.12.5 (svn 667)
	- Improved the shift value determination to make it more robust 
	against outliers in script bam2wig.pl. Additionally, the model 
	data that is written is now centered over the shift peak to 
	make evaluations more interpretable. 
	- Fixed a bug where 0 or negative coordinates may be written 
	to varStep wig files in script bam2wig.pl.
v.1.12.4 (svn 662)
	- Improved the efficiency of scanning for high coverage regions 
	and calculating 3 prime shift values in script bam2wig.pl; Each 
	reference sequence is now scanned in parallel. Also added a new 
	option to write the shift profile model and correlation data. 
	The efficiency of writing bedGraph files was improved, giving 
	up to 2X increase in performance. The default maximum duplicate 
	value is now unlimited. Warnings about coverage beyond the ends 
	of chromosomes are now silenced unless verbose is turned on.
	- The script graph_data.pl can now execute in parallel to improve 
	efficiency when a list of datasets are provided in advance. A 
	list may now be provided in conjunction with the --all option. 
	- Improved recognition of the X-axis column in script 
	graph_profile.pl.
	- Fixed critical error when writing extended position bedGraph 
	files from script bam2wig.pl where reverse reads were not 
	extended appropriately in the 3 prime direction.

v.1.12.3 (svn 651)
	- Added user options to control the size of the memory buffer 
	when writing bedGraph files and the disk write frequency in 
	script bam2wig.pl.
	- Added option to control the output order of the features from 
	script pull_features.pl. The order may match either the input 
	list or input data file. Also improved automatic column identification 
	and avoid empty output files.
	- Script data2wig.pl will now write bedGraph files.
	- Fixed bug leading to excessive memory usage when writing a 
	fixedStep wig file from script bam2wig.pl. Thanks to Jeff for 
	reporting.
	- Fixed bug where writing strand values for gff or bed files may 
	not be written correctly.
	- Fixed bug leading to errors loading input files with comment or 
	empty lines in the middle of data lines.
	- Fixed bug to avoid log of 0 errors in script bam2wig.pl.

v.1.12.2 (svn 642)
	- Scripts find_enriched_regions.pl and CpG_calculator.pl are now 
	multi-threaded. The find_enriched_regions.pl also has additional 
	optimizations to reduce memory usage.
	- The script merge_datasets.pl now has the option to use a coordinate 
	string as a unique identifier when looking up features. This is 
	particularly helpful with BED, GFF, and other files with genomic 
	coordinates that do not have unique name identifiers.
	- A coordinate string in the format chromo:start-stop may now be 
	generated from coordinate values in data files using a new function 
	in the script manipulate_datasets.pl.
	- Fixed a bug regarding changing file extensions in script 
	join_data_file.pl, which gave odd output file names with scripts that 
	executed in parallel.

v.1.12.1 (svn 635)
	- Fixed bugs were gzip status and file extensions may be inappropriately 
	inherited. This may cause problems when joining children files from 
	parallel process forks.
	- Fixed bug where the interactive menu would exit upon an empty value
	in script manipulate_datasets.pl. A "q" must now be provided to exit.
	- Minor optimization when calculating shift values in script bam2wig.pl.

v.1.12 (svn 619)
	- Major improvements to performance of some data collection scripts by 
	adding multi-threaded options. These include get_datasets.pl, 
	get_relative_data.pl, average_gene.pl, and bam2wig.pl. The number of 
	CPU forks may be specified with the --cpu option (default 2). This option 
	requires the installation of Parallel::ForkManager, available through 
	CPAN. Run the check_dependencies.pl script to install it.
	- All gzip compression read and writes are now forked through an 
	external gzip utility for a considerable boost in performance (2-5X). 
	The gzip executable must be in your path for this to work (it usually 
	is on most Unix-like environments).
	- Added --long option when collecting data from long features in script 
	average_gene.pl.
	- Improved efficiency when collecting data from very large windows in 
	both get_relative_data.pl and average_gene.pl.
	- Summing the total number of read alignments in Bam files is also  
	multi-threaded. Summing the total number of intervals in a BigBed file 
	is also improved.
	- Fixed a critical error where not all windows had data collected when 
	using the script get_relative_data.pl

v.1.11 (svn 603)
	- Major revision of how features are now retrieved from the database 
	using primary_IDs rather than relying on unique names in the database. 
	Generating lists of features will now return Primary_ID, Name, and Type. 
	The Primary_ID is unique to a database and is usually non-portable. 
	Current feature lists with only Name and Type will still work, and are 
	subject to limitations of non-unique Names in the database. This affects 
	all scripts that work with database features, including get_features.pl, 
	get_feature_info.pl, get_datasets.pl, get_relative_data.pl, 
	average_gene.pl, get_intersecting_features.pl, and correlate_position_data.pl.
	- GFF3 annotation scripts get_ensembl_annotation.pl and ucsc_table2gff3.pl 
	now produce GFF3 files that better match the GFF3 specification. Names 
	are no longer made unique (which broke ties with the originating data), 
	proper Dbxref tags are attributed when external sources could be 
	identified, and chromosomes are now sorted by name. Other minor 
	improvements were also made.
	- Fixed critical bug that prevented spliced alignments from being 
	counted in script bam2wig.pl. Thanks to Pinal K. for reporting.

v.1.10.3 (svn 597)
	- Unified column names and improved their recognition in scripts 
	get_feature_info.pl and the graphing scripts graph_data.pl, 
	graph_histogram.pl, and graph_profile.pl.
	- Graphing scripts now write the output graph directory in the input 
	file parent directory instead of the current directory.

v.1.10.2 (svn 591)
	- Added a new option of position when adjusting coordinates of retrieved
	features using the script get_features.pl. Coordinates may be adjusted
	at the 5 prime, 3 prime, or both ends of stranded features. This also 
	fixes bugs where collected features on the reverse strand with adjusted
	coordinates were not reported properly.
	- Improved automatic recognition of the name, score, and other columns
	in the convertor scripts data2bed.pl, data2gff.pl, and data2wig.pl. 
	- Improved the Cluster and Treeview export function in script
	manipulate_datasets.pl. The CDT files generated now include separate ID
	and NAME columns per the specification, and new manipulations are
	included prior to exporting, including percentile rank and log2.
	- The convert null function now also converts zero values if requested
	in script manipulate_datasets.pl.
	- Added new option of a minimum size when trimming windows in the script
	find_enriched_regions.pl.
	- Increased the radius from 35 bp to 50 bp when verifying a putative
	mapped nucleosome in script map_nucleosomes.pl, leading to fewer
	overlapping or offset nucleosomes.
	- Added new option to re-center offset nucleosomes in script
	verify_nucleosome_mapping.pl. Also improved report formatting.
	- Added checks and warnings when writing file names longer than 256
	characters. Some scripts automatically generate file names that may
	exceed this limit, preventing writing. File names are now truncated.
	Thanks to Adam F. for reporting.
	- Added new methods and code improvements to the gff3 parsing library.
	- Fixed a bug in script merge_datasets.pl where the column index for a
	second file may not be properly validated leading to premature
	termination.
	- Fixed a bug where multiple datasets combined with an ampersand for
	merging were not properly verified. 
	- Fixed a bug where a user may not be prompted to select a dataset from
	a database if none was supplied from the command line.
	- Fixed a bug where files containing trailing nulls do not load
	properly.
	- Fixed a bug related to finding specific data columns by name.
	- Fixed a bug with writing summary files.

v.1.10.1 (svn 568)
	- Added support for Bio::DB::Fasta in the main BioToolBox library, and
	added the support to scripts data2fasta.pl and CpG_calculator.pl. Any
	BioToolBox program that requires chromosome information or sequence can
	now use a genomic multi-fasta or directory of fasta files in the --db
	option.
	- Fixed critical error in data2gff.pl that prevented files from being
	converted to GFF format.
	- Fixed critical error merge_datasets.pl that prevented column headers
	from being written to the output file.
	- Made the warning about unavailable files on the UCSC FTP server less
	scary in the script ucsc_table2gff3.pl.
	- Updated and clarified some script documentation.

v.1.10 (svn 559)
	- Significantly improved performance when collecting data from Bam files
	by using a low level API. Improvements of at least 2X may be realized.
	- Significantly improved the performance of the bam2wig.pl script by at
	least 2X. Added a new option of recording extended regions across the
	predicted fragment based on empirically determined shift values.
	Sampling to determine shift values has been increased. BedGraph files
	are now written more efficiently. Maximum number of identical reads are
	now enforced.
	- Significantly improved the performance of the split_bam_by_isize.pl
	script to increase speed by at least 2X. Added an option to skip
	checking of mates. Improved reporting of results.
	- Added a filter option to remove overlapping nucleosomes in script
	verify_nucleosome_mapping.pl; also fixed bugs in reporting offset
	distances and improved output reporting.
	- Removed confusing separate scan and tag datasets required for script
	map_nucleosomes.pl. Cleaned up and organized code. Fixed bugs that
	prevented datasets from being validated.
	- Fixed critical bug where data was not collected for the final row in
	script get_datasets.pl.
	- Fixed bugs with parsing unusual input files, for example commented
	header lines in bed files or inconsistent column numbers.
	- Fixed bug in script get_intersecting_features.pl where a strand column
	was expected even if it was not present.
	- Changed all tim library calls to use arrays instead of anonymous
	hashes for a cleaner API. 
	- Changed shebang lines to use /usr/bin/env to improve portability on
	systems with different Perl versions installed. 
	- Cleaned up and made POD documentation more consistent.
	- Add warnings about database users and passwords in configuration file. 

v.1.9.7 (svn 539)
	- Fixed critical bug where an exon containing all three 5'UTR, CDS, and
	3'UTR was not properly parsed in the script get_ensembl_annotation.pl.
	New command line options for to include or not CDS, UTR, and start/stop
	codons were added. Significant changes to improve and organize the code
	was also made.
	- Changed the method of assigning the GFF type for chromosomes and
	scaffolds based on their name in the script ucsc_table2gff3.pl.  Also
	made the inclusion of start and stop  codons enabled by default.
	- Removed annoying automatic column assignment for input GFF files in
	script data2bed.pl. GFF files are still handled properly if no columns
	are specified on the command line.

v.1.9.6 (svn 533)
	- Fixed critical bug in script ucsc_table2gff3.pl where single exons
	containing all three 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR subfeatures were not properly
	parsed into GFF3. This had resulted in an extended CDS longer than
	expected. Thanks to H. Stovall for reporting.
	- Added warnings when a sequence could not be generated to avoid
	division by 0 errors, and a slight correction to fraction calculations,
	in script CpG_calculator.pl.

v.1.9.5 (svn 525)
	- Changed the non-intuitive --except option to a more intuitive --zero
	option in script manipulate_datasets.pl; this is now a boolean option to
	include or exclude zero values when calculating statistics. The printed
	statistics output has also been cleaned up and no longer includes
	decimal formatting. The export function will automatically generate a
	name when executed automatically.
	- Added capability to use a column of source values rather than a static
	text string for the GFF source tag in script data2gff.pl. Also made
	improvements to the interactive ask session.
	- Added the capability to use a big file dataset as the database for
	chromosome information in script find_enriched_regions.pl.
	- Added an option to automatically convert the output file to a BED file
	in script get_gene_regions.pl, and included a description of the --in
	option in the POD documentation.

v.1.9.4 (svn 519)
	- Fixed first critical bug in script get_datasets.pl where strand
	information in input files with genomic coordinates (e.g. BED files) was
	not considered when adjusting coordinates (start, stop, or fractional). 
	- Fixed second critical bug in script get_datasets.pl where collecting
	fractional data for named database features resulted in data collection
	over the entire feature.
	- Improved interpretation of input file features as genomic regions or
	named features in script get_datasets.pl.
	- Changed the --set_strand option to --force_strand in multiple data
	collection scripts. This should make the function a little more obvious
	as to its purpose. Documentation changed as appropriate.

v.1.9.3 (svn 516)
	- Fixed bug where wig definition lines may not be written when no
	alignments exist in the first 2 Mb of a chromosome when converting a bam
	file to a wig file in script bam2wig.pl. Definition lines are now always
	written. Thanks to Matt J. for reporting.
	- Fixed bug where the format_with_commas sub was not properly imported
	into the tim_db_helper library
	- Fixed bug where the bed output from script get_features.pl did not
	properly report strand information. 

v.1.9.2 (svn 510)
	- Fixed critical bug where codon changes were not reported correctly for
	minus strand genes in script locate_SNPs.pl. Thanks to Craig K. for
	reporting.

v.1.9.1 (svn 507)
	- Added critical code to interpret strand information from input files
	such as Bed and GFF into BioPerl standards. Essential for collecting
	stranded data. Also properly writes back strand information for valid
	Bed and GFF files
	- Updated and unified internal library methods for validating and
	requesting database feature types. By default, all database features are
	presented to the user as a list when selecting database features to
	collect data. The source_exclude parameter in the biotoolbox.cfg
	configuration file is now deprecated.
	- Upgraded script get_intersecting_features.pl to automatically
	recognize input file columns and search for more than 1 feature type
	- Fixed bug in script get_datasets.pl where the program will not
	continue when only a data database was provided
	- Fixed bug of requesting index when using a .kgg file as a gene list in
	script pull_features.pl
	- Fixed bug in generating file name for Treeview export function in
	script manipulate_datasets.pl
	- Fixed behavior when reading files to prevent adding the current
	program name to the metadata when the input file does not have this
	metadata
	- Minor updates to script novo_wrapper.pl
	
v.1.9.0 (svn 493)
	- Added new script get_features.pl which generates a list of features
	for one or more feature types from a database. Information about the
	features may be returned, including name, type, and coordinates. Sub
	features may be included. The data may be written as a BioToolBox
	formatted text file, GFF or BED.
	- Added new script correlate_position_data.pl that calculates a Pearson
	correlation between the score values at identical positions along a
	feature between two datasets. This helps in identifying changes in
	spatial distribution of values. An option for calculating shifts is also
	available.
	- Improved Big File generation such that Bio::DB::BigWig or
	Bio::DB::BigBed is no longer required just to generate the big file, as
	conversion uses external utilities anyway.
	- Fixed generation of bin values when calculating distribution
	frequencies in scripts data2frequency.pl and graph_histogram.pl

v.1.8.7 (svn 487)
	- Added new command line options to script merge_datasets.pl to control
	the program's behavior. The "--lookupname" option allows you to specify
	the name of the lookup column, while "--manual" turns off all automatic
	guessing of columns. Also improved handling of original_file metadata.
	- Added a new option to collect data from long features (such as genomic
	annotations) instead of point data (microarray or sequence data) in
	script get_relative_data.pl.
	- Added option to convert to and from Roman numerals in chromosome names
	and support for wig files in script change_chr_prefix.pl
	- Added option to change the IP port number when connecting to a remote
	MySQL database host in script get_ensembl_annotation.pl
	- Fixed bug to properly close opened files in script split_data_file.pl
	and avoid unnecessary error messages.
	- Modified statements and warnings regarding step and span values in
	script data2wig.pl

v.1.8.6 (svn 477)
	- Added numerous enhancements and bug fixes to script data2wig.pl,
	including automatically assigning the span parameter in the wig file,
	identifying coordinate columns, adding command line options for
	coordinate columns, and updating the POD documentation
	- Improved the treeview export function in script manipulate_datasets.pl
	to include different manipulations, including median center of genes or
	datasets, converting to Z-scores, and converting null values. Also
	changed the default output name to <basename>.cdt.
	- Added advanced option to script merge_datasets.pl to specify the
	column order on the command line instead of interactively. Also
	increased the number of columns that can be specified as letters.
	- Added the "value" command line option to specify the type of data to
	collect to the script find_enriched_regions.pl. Also added the sum
	method plus some improvements for identifying depleted regions.
	- Updated the script run_cluster.pl to accept any file name as input,
	and added basic file format validation checks prior to running the
	cluster algorithm, among a few other minor improvements
	- Improved handling of error messages when attempting to open databases
	that do not exist or can not otherwise be opened.
	- Added more support for reading bedgraph files, dealing with track
	lines and possibly empty lines
	- Collecting data from bigWig files that use spanned features (span > 1
	bp) are now collected at every base rather than just the start position
	- Fixed bug where more than two files were not properly merged using
	lookup in script merge_datasets.pl
	- Fixed bug to allow data to be collected for Bed files from indexed
	data files without specifying a database in script get_datasets.pl

v.1.8.5 (svn 461)
	- Fixed critical bug where all knownGene feature strands are reversed in
	script ucsc_table2gff3.pl
	- Fixed critical bug where the sign is flipped when generating Z-scores
